# Clip Eastwood – Unresolved Changes, Goals, or Plans

## 1. Enabling Direct Messaging to the Bot

- **Goal:** Enable sending messages to the Slack bot (removing "Sending messages to this app has been turned off").
- **Status:** No code or setup logic ensures the Slack App Home setting "Allow users to send Slash commands and messages from the messages tab" is enabled. This must be done manually in the Slack app configuration dashboard.


## 2. Automated Slack App Configuration Checks

- **Goal:** Add code or documentation to check/warn if the Slack app is not configured to allow DMs.
- **Status:** No such check or warning exists in the code.


## 3. Persona/Behavioral Enhancements

- **Goal:** Maintain a specific persona for the bot (Clip Eastwood) and improve contextual/accurate responses.
- **Status:** Persona prompts and context handling exist, but there is no mechanism to dynamically update or enforce persona settings if Slack or Gemini APIs change.


## 4. User Feedback for Disabled Messaging

- **Goal:** Notify users/admins with instructions if messaging is disabled.
- **Status:** No detection or feedback for this scenario in the code.


## 5. Automated Onboarding or Setup Instructions

- **Goal:** Improve developer experience with onboarding/setup instructions or checks.
- **Status:** No onboarding or setup helper present.


### Summary Table

| Change/Goal | Present in Code? | Notes |
| :-- | :--: | :-- |
| Enable DMs to bot via App Home setting | ✗ | Must be done manually in Slack app config |
| Code/docs to check/warn about DM setting | ✗ | No setup check or warning exists |
| Persona enforcement/test | ✗ | Persona prompt exists, but no dynamic check |
| User/admin feedback if DMs are disabled | ✗ | No error handling or notification |
| Automated onboarding/setup helper | ✗ | No onboarding or environment validation |

# Formatting, Markdown, and Slack Integration

## 1. Markdown to Slack mrkdwn

- **Problem:** Bot output in Slack displays raw Markdown syntax instead of mrkdwn.
- **Status:** `format_for_slack` does some conversion but not all (e.g., bold, italics, bullet points, numbered lists, strikethrough, blockquotes, code blocks).

### Summary Table

| Unresolved Item/Goal | Present in Code? | Next Step |
| :-- | :--: | :-- |
